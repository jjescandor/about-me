# about-me
### Lab 02

I built a guessing game website with seven questions prompted to the user when they load the rendered page [here](https://jjescandor.github.io/about-me/). The user has to provide a name and answer at least one question correctly to enter the website.

## The Five questions are:

1. Do I like gardening?
2. Is 'Both Sides Now' one of my favorite songs?
3. Do I like to paint?
4. Do I like to listen to podcast on my way to work?
5. Is my dog's name Kai?

### About ME

* I'm a US Navy veteran, a Systems Engineer and a Defense Consultant. I spent my Naval career as a Systems and Logistics Analyst. I was deployed to the Middle East aboard USS Truman and Djibouti, Africa. I also spent a tour overseas in Japan. I currently live in Virginia Beach, Va with my dog Kai and my cat Luna I have an associates degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Florida International University as well as a software development certification from Code Fellows.<br/>

* My goal is to leverage my technical and management experience in building ethical and sustainable technology and business model. As the pace and scale of innovation accelerates and our technology matures, heading into block chain, machine learning and artificial intelligence, we need to cultivate a collective awareness and movement that technology should be sustainable, empathetic and ethical. The next disruption in technology should improve our way of life and bring the best expression of our humanity.<br/>

* Fun facts about me. One of my favorite songs is ["Both Sides Now"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKQSlH-LLTQ) by Joni Mithell. It is hauntingly poetic and beautiful. One of my hobbies is gardening. I dabble into painting, mainly using oil and acrylic. Check out my Instagram to see some of my work. I kove to listen to podcast on my way to work and music on the way home.<br/>
